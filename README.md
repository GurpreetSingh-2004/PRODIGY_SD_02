The Number Guessing Game is an interactive program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. This game is designed to be both entertaining and engaging, providing users with instant feedback on their guesses. Here’s how it works:

Random Number Generation: At the start of the game, the program generates a random integer within a specified range (for example, between 1 and 100).

User Interaction: The user is prompted to enter their guess. The program provides clear instructions on the valid range for guesses.

Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the program compares the user's input to the randomly generated number:

If the guess is too high, the program will inform the user that their guess was too high.
If the guess is too low, the program will inform the user that their guess was too low.
If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the user.
Attempts Counter: The program keeps track of the number of attempts the user makes to guess the correct number. Once the user guesses correctly, the program displays the total number of attempts taken.

Game Continuation: The user can choose to play again or exit the game after a successful guess.

Features:
Random Number Generation: Utilizes built-in libraries to generate a random number.
Input Validation: Ensures the user’s guess is a valid integer within the specified range.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides clear instructions and feedback to enhance user experience.
Replay Option: Allows users to play multiple rounds of the game without restarting the program.
